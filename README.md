# Eudaimonia

### Eudaimonia is a Greek word literally translating to the state or condition of good spirit, and which is commonly translated as happiness or welfare. In the works of Aristotle, eudaimonia was the term for the highest human good in older Greek tradition. It is the aim of practical philosophy-prudence, including ethics and political philosophy, to consider and experience what this state really is and how it can be achieved.

## what to expect: A ubi framework that uses crypto and AI to equally distribute resources when the whole stuff goes down.

### Universal Basic Income (UBI) is an economic policy proposal where all citizens receive a regular, unconditional payment from the government, regardless of employment or income status. The goal is to provide financial security, reduce poverty, and simplify welfare systems. Advocates argue that UBI promotes equality and addresses automation’s impact on jobs. 

### Recently saw a tweet on X.com, and it said something like "AI won't replace programmers, it will only help them replace people in other jobs", around early last year (2024, Happy new year btw) i would have agreed with this point of view but there's Recently been a huge leap in terms of AI capabilities(with open Ai's latest model o1) i am utterly sure we have entered a whole new era, the future could dreadful be or amazing, it totally depends on what humans collectively do to help, EudaImonia. 


### Do you think humanoid robots(or some or all forms of robots) might takeover doing hard jobs and maybe all jobs, leaving no work to humans?,
#### i think YES, it happens(and i predict 2052 is the year where we see the greatest change/contrast between the old and the new world).
### Do think every human has the right to have a 'basically' comfortable life (food, clothing and shelter for starters)?
#### i think YES, of course!

### EUDAMONIA's goal is to create a system where all humans(connected to this network) receive a regular, unconditional payment from the system, regardless of employment or income status(using blockchain tech, cryptos and ai). The goal is to provide financial security, reduce poverty, and simplify welfare systems. Eudamonia's network would support equality and addresses automation’s impact on jobs.
